# Basic Clock App
This is a basic clock app created by Aaron McCollum on 8/27/2020.

For help on setting an interval, I used: https://www.elated.com/creating-a-javascript-clock/

For help on updating the current time shown instead of adding new content to the Div each time (I also loved the font style and borrowed that as well): https://www.codesdope.com/blog/article/how-to-create-a-digital-clock-using-javascript/
